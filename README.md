This is a budgeting and expense tracker. In summary, when using this application, a user will have the ability to input expenses, establish budgets, track their spending trends, and categorize their expenses.

HOW TO RUN/TEST CODE:
Download the app folder and move it into the location where one will run the file in flutter/dart. 

Other important information:
Login feature: located top right of the home page. Username is test@test.com and Password is test123, currently it is in a work in progress with planning to add local/cloud account saving. It can login and once logged in, the login button that was once and the top right will change into a logout button.

Expense entries: In order to add entries to the expense tracker. One can do so by pressing the plus button that is found in the expense page. There one can continue by adding the name,description,price and date information. Once finished, the expense will show up on the page. User can add multiple expenses to this page

Report Graphs: Graphs are based off the expenses.dart information. Whatever the user will put into their expenses page, the graph will show up on the reports page to indicate on how much the user have spent on their budget. The information regarding the graphs is still a work in progress (having to add budgeting and better organization). Graphs should update real time with the expenses. So when the user adds a new expense it will show up immediately and if the user deletes one of their expenses, the same should happen.
